Hello NASequencer
-----------------

### hello.nas

480: D2
480: E2
480: F2
```

The first example is that's it!  
Type above snippet in editor-window.
Then save it.

Now, you can see the sequence in document window.
The sequence will be like following list.

```
   | 1               2
========================
   | .           x---.  
   | .       x---    .

Check the Basic Structure
-------------------------

#### hello.nas
```
480: C2 // Steps and Note
480: D2
480: E2
480: F2
------------- // Comment
480: G2
480: A2
480: B2
480: C3 E3 G3
```

### File Extention
The file extention ".nas" means that file is "Note as Sequence" format.

### Steps
In "Note as Sequence", `480:` means 'Step'.
Step specifies how many ticks the sequence is forwarded.
Gatetime, that is duration of notes, is also decided by step.

The defalut ticks per a measure on 4/4 beat is 1920.
480 means quarter note length.

**Tips**  
You can change config of ticks per quarter note by [RESOLUTION](note-as-sequence.md#RESOLUTION) statement.
However in most of cases, it's unnecessary to change it because 480 is the defact standard of division used by many DAW.

### Note
`C2` means C note with octave 2.  Valid note range is C-2 to G8.

**Tips**  

- `#` is for the sharp, `b` is for the flat and `n` is for natural
- Double sharp and double flat is acceptable
- Natural is only affected when [KEY](note-as-sequence.md#KEY) is specified

### Comment
`==` `--` `//` can be used the line comment. It does not affect the result of sequence.
`/* */` is also available for multiple line comments.
`==` and `--` are expected to used for readability.

Next Step
---------
### Listen to example
Show welcom window by menu [Window] -> [Welcome to NASequencer].
