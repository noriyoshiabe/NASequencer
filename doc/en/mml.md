About MML
---------
Music Macro Language (MML) is a music description language that was invented in the early days of computer music for sequencing by text descriptions.
For historical reasons, there are many implementations and no standards of language definition.
The MML on NASequencer bases on notation of [FIMML](https://flmml.codeplex.com) that is a Flash library commonly used in Japan.
However, notations for sound source is not compatible because NASequencer focuses MIDI in contrast that FIMML focuses FM oscillator.
For notations for MIDI, NASequencer adopts several notations of [mml2mid](http://hpc.jp/~mml2mid/mml2mid.txt) and adds NASequencer's own notations.
